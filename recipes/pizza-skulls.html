        </li>
        <li>
            Fill the dough by layering 1 tablespoon mozzarella, 1 tablespoon pizza sauce, 1 tablespoon pepperoni, 1 tablespoon mozzarella, 1 tablespoon pizza sauce, 1 tablespoon mozzarella, 1 tablespoon parmesan, and 1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning in the center of the dough square. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold sides of dough together and pinch tightly to seal, trimming and discarding any excess dough if necessary. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat filling and sealing process with remaining dough squares and remaining cheese, pizza sauce, pepperoni, and Italian seasoning.

        <li>
            Bake in preheated oven until baked through and lightly golden, 16 to 18 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Carefully remove baked skulls from pan and transfer to a serving plate. Let cool 5 minutes before serving with additional pizza sauce for dipping, if desired.
